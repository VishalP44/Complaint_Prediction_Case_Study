# Predicting Customer Complaints: A Proactive Approach to Service Delivery

> **Disclaimer:** This project is a personal case study that replicates the methodology from a project I completed in a professional capacity. The code has been rewritten, and the original proprietary data has been replaced with a synthetic, anonymized dataset to protect confidentiality and intellectual property.

## 1. The Business Problem

In the property management sector, a rising number of repair-related complaints presents a significant operational and financial challenge. This trend indicates resident dissatisfaction often driven by delays and unresolved issues.

This project moves beyond a reactive complaint management model. By leveraging machine learning on historical repair and complaint data, the goal is to **proactively identify repair jobs at high risk of becoming a formal complaint**. The developed model assigns a "Complaint Risk Score" to open repair jobs, enabling the business to:

* **Intervene early** with targeted support for high-risk cases.
* **Enhance resident satisfaction** and experience.
* **Improve operational efficiency** by allocating resources effectively.
* **Reduce the volume and cost** associated with formal complaints.
